Project Overview
My project "BulgariaExplorer" is a web SPA application built with React and Node.js + MongoDB as a backend service. It provides a platform where users can browse, share and manage their travel trips in Bulgaria. 

Users can log in (and logout), explore all trips on the catalog page, view trip details, create trips, edit and delete their own trips, add/remove trips from their wishlist. For easy trip management each user has it's own area ("My Trips" and "My Wishlist"). Under "My Trips" each user can find their own created trips. Under "My Wishlist" each user can find their saved trips, favorite Bulgarian destinations they want to visit

Guest (before login) can register, explore all trips on the catalog page and view trip details. Guests have no access to the functional activities of the web app.
